~Jacksonian~
    
Young professional yuppie
Pet yo' puppy
Hit the gym everyday with my duffie
    
I should feel lucky
To have money
But I don’t
I am ungrateful fuck me

Always hungry
Can’t feel comfy
Chasing dreams like cumulus so puffy
    
Haters can’t snuff me
Police don’t cuff me
Play my ocarina so my music can drug me 
    
Every day trying to improve
That is my signature move
Readin’, skiiin’, trainin’, playin’, workin’ on communication
    
Waitin’ for that day 
On my bed I lay
What I’m not doing my thoughts don’t say
    
Distract me, attack me, you will never crack me
I am a man with a plan outran the lands of painting tomato cans
    
Manufacturing the happenings avoiding my own saddening
Everytime I start unravelling I keep on paddling
In my mind these thoughts keep rattling
Rattatattatattatatattling
